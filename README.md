domain-crystallography
======================
A crystallography domain ontology based on [EMMO][1] and the [CIF
core][2] dictionary. It is implemented as a formal language.


Status
------
- [ ] Proposal
- [X] accepted, under development
- [ ] official

This domain ontology is work-in-progress (WIP), it is in the process
of being accepted as a task group by the EMMC.

* Application submitted: 15 June 2020
* Application accepted on: TBD


Imported Ontologies
-------------------
This ontology builds on top of EMMO. See the following table for version
compatibilies:

| Imported Ontologies | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| EMMO                | 1.0.0-alpha2      |


Obtaining domain-crystallography
--------------------------------

This ontology build on EMMO-1.0.0-alpha2. The correct path to 
the inferred verion 'emmo-inferred' is specified in the catalog file, catalog-v001.xml.

The domain ontology is obtained with:

    git clone git@github.com:emmo-repo/domain-crystallography.git

When opening batteryInterface.owl in Protege, the correct version of emmo-inferred will
be downloaded and imported.

In EMMO-python correct import is obatined with 

   get_ontology('crystallography.owl).load(url_from_catalog=True)
