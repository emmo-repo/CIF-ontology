Crystallography
===============
A toplevel crystallography domain ontology based on EMMO and the CIF core
dictionary. Implemented as a formal language.


Dependencies
------------
The crystallography domain ontology is built on top of EMMO and some
of its modules. The following table describes the version
compatibility between those ontologies:

| Dependency | Version           |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| EMMO       | marketplace-1.0.1 |


Obtaining crystallography
-------------------------
This repository now include the correct version of EMMO as a submodule.
Hence, this repository should be cloned with:

    git clone --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules git@gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de:ontology/domains/crystallography.git
