domain-crystallography
======================
A crystallography domain ontology based on [EMMO][1] and the [CIF
core][2] dictionary. It is implemented as a formal language.


Status
------
- [ ] Proposal
- [X] accepted, under development
- [ ] official

This domain ontology is work-in-progress (WIP), it is in the process
of being accepted as a task group by the EMMC.

* Application submitted: 15 June 2020
* Application accepted on: TBD


Imported Ontologies
-------------------
This ontology builds on top of EMMO. See the following table for version
compatibilies:

| Imported Ontologies | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| EMMO                | marketplace-1.0.1 |


Obtaining domain-crystallography
--------------------------------
For faster access, this repository now include the correct version of
EMMO as a git submodule.  Hence, use the following command when
cloning this repository:

    git clone --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules git@github.com:emmo-repo/domain-crystallography.git
