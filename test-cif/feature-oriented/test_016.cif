 The uppercase Greek letter alpha can be written as \A, while
 the lowercase Greek letter omega can be written as \W.

 Some accented letter and other characters can also be expressed,
 i.e. Ervin Schr\"odinger, Anders Jonas \%Angstr\"om.

 CIF also provides special codes for some symbols that might
 not have obvious equivalent Unicode symbols, for example,
 '\\ddb ' which represents a delocalized double bond.

 Superscript and subscript can be represented by using a matching
 pair of the '^' and '~' symbols respectively, i.e. ^14^C, H~2~O.
