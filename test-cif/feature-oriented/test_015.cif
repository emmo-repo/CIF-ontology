##
# A CIF 1.1 file that showcases the difference between CIF special values
# and literal characters that are used to represent those special values.
# AUDIT loop entries in data block 'test_015' should be interpreted in
# the following way:
# - 1: a literal question mark symbol.
# - 2: a literal period symbol.
# - 3: CIF special value that means that the value is unknown.
# - 4: CIF special value that means that the value is inapplicable.
#
# Value delimiters in entries '1' and '2' could be easily replaced with
# any of the allowed delimiters without changing the interpretation.
#
# Note, that this specific example was constructed to be as simple as
# possible, therefore it might not make a lot of sense. However, in some
# situations the distinction between special value and a literal character
# does matter.
