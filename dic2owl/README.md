# Convert CIF dictionaries to OWL Turtle files - dic2owl

This Python package presents a CLI `dic2owl` that can convert a CIF dictionary to an OWL Turtle file using the schema developed in the EMMO-Crystallography EMMC Task Group.

## Ontologization schema

The early schema development can be found in the [#16](https://github.com/emmo-repo/CIF-ontology/issues/16) issue.

It has been developed by the EMMO-Crystallography EMMC Task Group, which consists of:

- Casper Welzel Andersen, EPFL
- Jesper Friis, SINTEF
- James Hester
- Saulius Grazulis
- Rickard Armiento
- Emanuele Ghedini
- Francesca LÃ¸nstad Bleken, SINTEF
- Joana Morgado, Fraunhofer IWM
- Stuart Chalk

## Related work and dependencies

This package relies on the [PyCIFRW](https://bitbucket.org/jamesrhester/pycifrw) package developed by James Hester to parse CIF (`.cif`) and CIF dictionary (`.dic`) files.

## For developers

### Pre-commit (Python formatting)

To ensure similar formatting, this repository uses `pre-commit`, which runs prior to every `git commit`.
Specifically, [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) is used as the default Python formatter.

To install in your local clone, `cd` to the root of the repository and run

```console
/path/to/CIF-ontology$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
